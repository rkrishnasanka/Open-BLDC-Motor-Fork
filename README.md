## Custom ESC Hardware

This project contains the KiCAD design files for the custom ESC PCB.
The project was designed with KiCAD Version 6.0.6 and should be able to be edited this way.

Any non standard components are located in the `Additional_Components` folder. The `bom` folder contains an HTML file generated by the iBOM plugin with the layout and placement of all components.

The `ir2130_driver` folder was a first idea for the hardware with a different driver IC which was abandoned. It is kept for documentation purposes.

The git tag `evaluation_board` contains the first produced version of this board in a bigger formfactor with additional debugging pads.
